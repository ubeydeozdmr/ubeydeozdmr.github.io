            Countrypedia is an application where you can see all the countries,
            search among these countries, and get information about the country
            you choose, such as the country's name, flag, coat of arms, currency,
            border countries, capital, which continent it is located on,
            telephone code, population, location on the map (and more).

            You can search between countries not only by name, but also by
            capital, currency, language spoken, etc. you can search. Apart from
            this, you can sort the countries alphabetically or randomly (as they
            come), select a random country by clicking the random button, mark
            the countries you want as bookmarks and use Countrypedia in dark
            mode.

          <h2 class="project__question">
            What is the story behind Countrypedia?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            While I was still in the process of learning JavaScript, I was
            watching a course on JavaScript on Udemy (Jonas Schmedtmann's
            <a
              class="project__link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/"
              >Complete JavaScript course</a
            >). During the course, a country-related API (<a
              class="project__link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://restcountries.com"
              >restcountries.com</a
            >) was used to learn asynchronous operations (such as async/await).
            After finishing the course, I wanted to make a serious VanillaJS
            application. Since I am interested in countries and it is an
            easy-to-use and well-developed API, I wanted to take the level of
            what can be done with this API one step further and created
            <a
              class="project__link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://v1.countrypedia.app"
              >Countrypedia v1</a
            >. In the first version, you could only list countries, search for
            countries only by their names, learn the information of the specific
            country you selected, and use dark mode. The first version had the
            trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I released
            <a
              class="project__link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://v2.countrypedia.app/"
              >Countrypedia v2</a
            >
            within 1 year, and this version was basically just a design change.
            New features (alphabetical sorting, searching for countries by other
            categories, adding the country as a bookmark, viewing the country on
            the map, etc.) were added after v2 was released. Also, in v2, CSS has
            been replaced with SCSS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project__qa">
          <h2 class="project__question">
            Do you have any plans for Countrypedia?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            I plan to write the project from scratch with React and ChakraUI in
            2023. This time I want to make improvements on both UI and UX side.
            Also, if the v4 version of the REST Countries API is released before
            this process is completed, I can add new information and write the
            object structures more easily in the project.
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            When I first wrote v2, it was actually just a design change, I added
            almost all of the features I mentioned in the What's new in v2
            section below by patching it on the project. This caused the project
            to be written more cleanly at first, but later the code became harder
            to understand and the MVC structure was broken. Moreover, the URL
            based navigation I developed especially for phones caused new bugs.
            Some bugs I've discovered so far:
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            -> When you click on the Random button (the one with the 5 dot dice
            symbol), "cca3 codes" appear instead of the "full name" of the
            countries in the Borders section of the countries (When you select a
            country yourself, this part appears correctly)
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            -> Regarding URL navigation: If the user exits the detailsView
            (closes the modal window) or returns to the main page using only the
            buttons or just the back button of the phone & PC after opening the
            site, it's fine. However, if it does both at once, the return
            function doesn't work as expected (needs to press go back button on
            browser or navigation drawer all the time).
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            So the point I want to focus on in v3 will be developability and user
            experience (UX) rather than design. I will use ChakraUI (probably) as
            design and write the project with React. As the project grows, it
            becomes harder to write and add/remove with VanillaJS (also
            error-prone), while React is quite flexible.
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            From this point on I will not add any new features to v2, only bug
            fixes and package updates (Max until end of 2024). I will also add a
            new section to the README.md file for v3. I will develop v3 on the

            before fully releasing it. You can also review the new README.md.
            When it reaches a certain stage, the preview link will be shared.
