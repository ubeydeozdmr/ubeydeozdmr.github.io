          <p class="project__answer">
            CremaBlog is a markdown-based blog website project that is created
            using the MERN stack. It is a full-stack project that allows editors
            (or admin) to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It also
            has authentication and authorization features for managing user
            access. Additionally, it provides a responsive design.

            What other features does CremaBlog have?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            In CremaBlog, users can create an account, log in, and log out. They
            can also update their profile information. The website has a search
            feature for blog posts. It also has a dark mode feature for users who
            prefer dark themes. The website is responsive and works on various
            devices, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and mobile.

            What is the technology stack of Crema To-Do?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            CremaBlog is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB,
            Express.js, React, and Node.js. MongoDB is used as the database to
            store blog posts and user information. Express.js is used as the
            backend framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. React is
            used to create the user interface and manage the frontend logic. And
            Node.js is used as the runtime environment for the backend server.
            Additionally, Docker is used for containerization. It ensures that
            the application runs consistently in different environments. Caddy is
            used as a web server that provides easy configuration for serving
            static and dynamic content.

            What is the deployment process for CremaBlog?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            The deployment process involves building the application and then
            using Docker to create a container for it. Once the container is
            ready, it can be deployed to a cloud provider or local server using
            Caddy for serving it to users.

            What is the story behind Crema To-Do?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            I wanted to do my markdown blog project, which I left incomplete
            years ago, with a nicer design and better functionality this time,
            and I started working on the site from the end of January 2025. I
            wanted to improve my relatively weak backend development skills, and
            naturally I started doing it here first. Then, after doing the design
            in isolation (html, css, tailwindcss and simple javascript), I
            started adapting it to the frontend with React. I have completed the
            first version of the project in 2-3 weeks by working on it in my free
            time. My goal is to continue enhancing the application by adding more
            features and improving user experience in future iterations.

          <h2 class="project__question">Do you have any plans for CremaBlog?</h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            Yes, I have plans to enhance CremaBlog by adding more features and
            improving the user experience. Some of the features I plan to add
            include user profiles, enhanced search capabilities, add tag
            functionality for posts, add comments functionality, and integrations
            with social media.
