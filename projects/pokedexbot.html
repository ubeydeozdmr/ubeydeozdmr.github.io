            You can view the list of Pokemon with /pklist (supported from

            type/ability of your choice with /pktype and /pkability commands. You
            can also obtain a list of pokémons that are suitable for a type you
            choose. (For example, you can get a list of all fire-type Pokémon.)

          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            For a while, I was interested in creating bots on Telegram and I made
            a bot using ManyBot, I also liked using RoseBot's features. The idea
            for a bot that displays Pokémon information belonged to my cousin. I
            was aware that adding these features one by one using services like
            ManyBot would be troublesome, so I thought it made sense to make a
            bot by coding and pulling data from somewhere instead. (See
            technology stack)

          <h2 class="project__question">
            Do you have any plans for Pokédex Bot?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            When I wrote this bot, I was still in the process of learning
            JavaScript. I can rewrite the project in a cleaner way and to cover
            and use the various features of the API in more detail. Although I
            haven't decided yet, I may try using
            <a
              class="project__link"
              target="_blank"

          <h2 class="project__question">LATE 2024 EDIT</h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            The activities of this bot will be stopped by the beginning of 2025
            at the latest. Here's why:
            <a
              class="project__link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://telegra.ph/About-stopping-bot-activitiesdevelopment-11-26"

            >
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            I first tried to make this Telegram bot in 2021. The reason I did
            this was because I was a coder, my cousin's dream of a Telegram bot
            related to Pokémon, and my interest in Telegram bots at the time.
            Although I had never watched Pokémon in real life, I created this bot
            because of my interest in coding and especially easy-to-use REST
            APIs. In this way, both my cousin, my brother, and I could use the
            bot, and others could also benefit from it.
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            After writing the bot with Telegraf.js (v3), I first deployed it to
            Amazon AWS, and later to Heroku (due to easy GitHub integration and
            some other reasons). At that time, Heroku was free to a certain
            extent and was more preferred at that time. But this didn't last
            long, after using my rights due to being a university student, I
            started paying 5 USD per month, however, I do not earn money through
            this bot or try to collect & log personal data of those who use the
            bot (except for November 2024 for the logging part, read the next
            paragraph to learn why).
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            By the end of 2024, we really rarely use Telegram among ourselves
            compared to the past, and naturally we do not use the bot. In order
            to find an answer to the question of whether others are still using
            this bot, I temporarily (only November 2024) added log information
            about who used the bot and what commands they entered, but I saw that
            no one was using it.
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            New features had come to both the Telegram Bot API and Telegraf.js.
            I, on the other hand, lost interest in Telegram bots and focused
            entirely on web development and mobile development. After a long
            time, of course, I could have re-read the documentation and
            re-written the bot and chosen a preferable PaaS, but when we put all
            the pieces I mentioned above together, I decided that this was an
            unnecessary effort.
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            Due to all this, all activities of Pokédex Bot will be stopped as of
            2025 at the latest. If there is really interest in this bot or if
            there is such a need one day, I may consider re-developing this bot
            and restarting its activities, but this will probably not happen.
