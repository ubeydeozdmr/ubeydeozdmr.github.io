          <p class="project__answer">
            Turkiye API allows you to retrieve data about the provinces,
            districts, neighborhoods and villages of Turkey (all or as much as
            you want), sort these provinces, districts, neighborhoods and
            villages (by name, license plate number, population, area covered,
            etc.), filter according to some characteristics of the provinces,
            districts, neighborhoods and villages. It is a REST API prepared for
            developers that you can do (such as showing only metropolises,
            showing districts with a population between 100000 and 500000).

          <p class="project__answer">
            Turkiye API is a REST API that uses Node.js and Express.js without
            any database. (It uses JSON files as a database.) It uses Pug as view
            engine. It is hosted on Heroku.

            What is the story behind Turkiye API?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            I created it inspired by Rest Countries API and PokÃ©API. What caught
            my attention was the lack of an API that prepares Turkey's provinces
            and districts (with some extra information). So, I created the Turkey
            API.

        <div class="project__qa">
          <h2 class="project__question">
            Do you have any plans for Turkiye API?
          </h2>
          <p class="project__answer">
            The v1 version seems to have started to lose its developability and
            maintainability. When I first started developing the project in 2022
            (I had just started my first year of university at that time), the
            name of the project (and of course also the repository) was
            "Provinces of Turkey API". The reason for this is that during the
            first few months when the API was first developed, you could only
            retrieve province information (Also, this information consisted of
            only five properties: id, name, population, areaCode and
            isMetropolitan). Over time, I focused on fixing the bugs of the API
            and adding new features (one of them was districts). Over time,
            districts became a schema in their own right, just like provinces,
            but instead of being written separately with an ID-Key connection,
            these districts were written in the district arrays of the relevant
            provinces in the same json file. This is the first problem, I have
            largely solved this problem for v1, but there are still some
            problems. The second problem was that there was no support for query
            parameters at first. These parameters were added step by step over
            time (first added "name, offset, limit", then filtering parameters,
            then fields, lastly sort).
          </p>
          <p class="project__answer">
            It is not easy to write the code from scratch without breaking the
            API requests of v1 users, however, I want to spare time for other
            projects and other work. That's why I'm taking a long break for this
            project. When the time comes, I will most likely start writing v2.
            Things I need to examine other sample APIs and also decide:
          </p>
          <ul class="project__unordered-list">
            <li class="project__list-item">
              Should I use database in v2 as opposed to v1?
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item">
              What kind of project structure should I create?
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item">
              Should I prefer
              <span class="project__inline-code">snake_case</span> instead of
              <span class="project__inline-code">camelCase</span>? (like
              <span class="project__inline-code">area_code</span> instead of
              <span class="project__inline-code">areaCode</span>)
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item">
              What kind of route structure should I use? (Should I use routes
              like
              <span class="project__inline-code"
                >/provinces/34/districts/1852</span
              >
              instead of separate routes for provinces, districts, etc.?
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item">
              Municipality support was not added to v1 because it would have been
              a bit complicated if I had added it.
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item">
              What kind of connection should there be between Schemas? (How
              exactly can we position the municipalities when there is an order
              like provinces > districts > neighborhoods + villages)
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item">
              fields property cannot set quadratic (or more nested) props, also
              sort property does not work for all fields. How can I find a
              solution to this?
            </li>
            <li class="project__list-item">
              Many more things I can't think of right now.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="project__answer">
            Because of all this, this time I will try to improve myself in terms
            of learning and plan well this time. The project has come a long way
            from when it first started and has much more advanced capabilities.
            Frankly, I think I've added enough features and made improvements to
            last until v2. I need some time to realize the things I plan to do
            for v2, so I'm taking a long break. When v2 is released (if it is
            released) it will have better and more descriptive documentation, be
            more systematic and expandable. You can still submit your
            suggestions, requests, etc. by opening an issue on the TÃ¼rkiye API
            GitHub page. you can write. In this case, I will also consider these
            for v2.
