The color scheme in the site design (for light mode) and card shadow technique was taken from Udemy course content [omnifood.dev](https://omnifood.dev) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io). Stepper component technique was taken from [lenmorld](https://codepen.io/lenmorld/pen/wxNRPX) by [Lenmor Ld](https://codepen.io/lenmorld). The rest of the design was made by me.
